    "title": "React – The library for web and native user interfaces",
    "content": "React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like `Thumbnail`, `LikeButton`, and `Video`. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.\r\n\r\nWhether you work on your own or with thousands of other developers, using React feels the same. It is designed to let you seamlessly combine components written by independent people, teams, and organizations.\r\n\r\n## Write components with code and markup\r\n\r\nReact components are JavaScript functions. Want to show some content conditionally? Use an `if` statement. Displaying a list? Try array `map()`. Learning React is learning programming.\r\n\r\nThis markup syntax is called JSX. It is a JavaScript syntax extension popularized by React. Putting JSX markup close to related rendering logic makes React components easy to create, maintain, and delete.\r\n\r\n## Add interactivity whereever you need it\r\n\r\nReact components receive data and return what should appear on the screen. You can pass them new data in response to an interaction, like when the user types into an input. React will then update the screen to match the new data.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t have to build your whole page in React. Add React to your existing HTML page, and render interactive React components anywhere on it.\r\n\r\n## Go full-stack with a framework\r\n\r\nReact is a library. It lets you put components together, but it doesn\u2019t prescribe how to do routing and data fetching. To build an entire app with React, we recommend a full-stack React framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Remix](https://remix.run/).\r\n\r\nReact is also an architecture. Frameworks that implement it let you fetch data in asynchronous components that run on the server or even during the build. Read data from a file or a database, and pass it down to your interactive components.\r\n\r\n## Use the best from every platform\r\n\r\nPeople love web and native apps for different reasons. React lets you build both web apps and native apps using the same skills. It leans upon each platform\u2019s unique strengths to let your interfaces feel just right on every platform.\r\n\r\nWith React, you can be a web and a native developer. Your team can ship to many platforms without sacrificing the user experience. Your organization can bridge the platform silos, and form teams that own entire features end-to-end.\r\n\r\n## Join a community of millions\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re not alone. Two million developers from all over the world visit the React docs every month. React is something that people and teams can agree on.\r\n\r\nThis is why React is more than a library, an architecture, or even an ecosystem. React is a community. It\u2019s a place where you can ask for help, find opportunities, and meet new friends. You will meet both developers and designers, beginners and experts, researchers and artists, teachers and students. Our backgrounds may be very different, but React lets us all create user interfaces together.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the React community.",

OpenTofu can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.\r\n\r\nThe key features of OpenTofu are:\r\n\r\n- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.\r\n\r\n- **Execution Plans**: OpenTofu has a \"planning\" step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what OpenTofu will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when OpenTofu manipulates infrastructure.\r\n\r\n- **Resource Graph**: OpenTofu builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, OpenTofu builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.\r\n\r\n- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what OpenTofu will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.\r\n\r\n## Getting help and contributing\r\n\r\n- Have a question? Post it in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/opentofu/discussions) or on the [OpenTofu Slack](https://opentofu.org/slack/)!\r\n- Want to contribute?

    "title": "Valkey – A flexible distributed key-value datastore that is optimized for caching and other realtime workloads.",
    "content": "Valkey is an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore that supports a variety of workloads such as caching, message queues, and can act as a primary database. Valkey can run as either a standalone daemon or in a cluster, with options for replication and high availability.\r\n\r\nValkey natively supports a rich collection of datatypes, including strings, numbers, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and more. You can operate on data structures in-place with an expressive collection of commands. Valkey also supports native extensibility with built-in scripting support for Lua and supports module plugins to create new commands, data types, and more.\r\n\r\n## What is Valkey?\r\n\r\nValkey is a high-performance data structure server that primarily serves key/value workloads.\r\nIt supports a wide range of native structures and an extensible plugin system for adding new data structures and access patterns.\r\n\r\n## Beginnings\r\n\r\nGetting started with Valkey has changed substantially over the course of the year. When Valkey first launched at Open Source Summit North America, I recall excitedly telling people that you could build from source, get the binary from the website or even use a container. Now, you can get Valkey directly from the package manager in most Linux distributions (and more on the way in 2025). There are multiple options for containerization and operators to fit your needs. And, for those who want to let others run Valkey, it is also available as a service on Aiven, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, NetApp Instaclustr, UpCloud, and several more.\r\n\r\nThe buzz around Valkey caused no shortage of coverage. One theme that the initial Valkey coverage focused on was the speed that everything happened: only 8 days after the license change, the project had a release, was a Linux foundation project with supporters from a variety of companies around the industry:\r\n\r\n> An eight day timeline for a project of this size and scope is shocking. An eight day timeline to announce a project of this scope that includes names like AWS, Google and Oracle of all vendors is an event without any obvious precedent. Even setting the requisite legal approvals aside, naming and branding take time \u2013 as they did in this case, apparently. \u2013 [Stephen O'Grady](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2024/07/16/post-valkey-world/)\r\n\r\nOver the course of the year, the coverage shifted focus from establishment to velocity:\r\n\r\n> As per GitHub and as of this writing, it\u2019s got roughly 10 times as many contributors and is hundreds of commits ahead of Redis. It\u2019s like Redis, but with more caffeine, a bigger dev team, and a community that\u2019s suddenly not beholden to keeping requested features stuffed behind a paywall. \u2013 [Corey Quinn](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/aws-valkey-play-when-a-fork-becomes-a-price-cut/)\r\n\r\n## Stories\r\n\r\nBeyond seeing this coverage, less than six months after the establishment of the project a report indicated that [63% of respondents were already familiar with Valkey](https://thenewstack.io/redis-users-want-a-change/), so it\u2019s no surprise that there are countless folks already using it. These specific stories being told in public are a valuable data point for the next wave of migrations. At Open Source Summit Hong Kong in September, [Dirk Hohndel](https://www.facesofopensource.com/dirk-hohndel/) from Verizion talks about migrating his own app over to Valkey 8.0 release candidate and seeing a 3x performance increase.\r\n\r\n# Valkey is an open community project under LF Projects\r\n\r\nValkey a Series of LF Projects, LLC\r\n2810 N Church St, PMB 57274\r\nWilmington, Delaware 19802-4447",
