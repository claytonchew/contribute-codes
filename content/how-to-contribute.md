## For Volunteers

1. **Explore Projects**

Whether you’re a developer, designer, or someone with a passion for making an impact, you’ll find a project that aligns with your interests.
2. **Review Project Details**  
   Before you commit to volunteering, take the time to read the project description thoroughly. Check out the project’s website, repository, and any other provided resources to ensure it’s a cause you’re passionate about.
3. **Sign In with Github**  
   To volunteer for a project, you’ll need to sign in with your GitHub account. This helps project owners verify your identity and connect with you easily.
4. **Request to Contribute**  
   Once you find a project you want to support, click on the “Volunteer this project” button. This will prompt you to fill in your contact details and a brief message explaining how you’d like to help. This message will be sent to the project owner, along with your information.
5. **Connect and Collaborate**  
   If the project owner accepts your request, they’ll contact you to discuss the next steps. From there, you’ll work together on the project, contributing your skills to make a real difference.
